        <p>This will be my personal website.</p>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Born in Mexico, I studied clinical neuropsychology in Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
            followed by a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging at University of York.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I'm currently finishing my PhD, where I focus on hemispheric specialisation. I am looking at key sites
            of the semantic cognition network and exploring whether their differences in functional connnectivity 
            as assessed by resting state fMRI can tell us why the left hemisphere is more involved in certain aspects of language.</p>
        <p>My research interests at the moment are focusing on how interactions between large-scale networks differ in the left and
            right hemisphere, and how this might give rise to lateralised cognitive functions. I am also quite interested in the organisation
            of semantic space and its neural implementation. I am keen on developing a set of tools over the following years to explore these topics
            using machine learning, representational similarity analysis, automated meta-analyses and cognitive decoding on fMRI data. </p>
        <p>I am a strong believer in open science and collaboration. I would like to harness the power of freely available big datasets
            to further my research agenda, as well as contributing to the sharing culture making extensive use of the Open Science Framework,
            registered reports, and making my data readily available in BIDS format whenever possible. </p>
        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>I've taught for nine years at the University level in various capacities: as a graduate teaching assistant, assistant lecturer and associate
            lecturer. I also tutor in statistics and supervise students research projects.</p>
