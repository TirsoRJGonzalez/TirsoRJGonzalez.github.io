        <h1>Tirso RJ Gonzalez Alam</h1>
        <p>This will be my personal website.</p>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Born in Mexico, I studied clinical neuropsychology in Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
            followed by a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging at University of York.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I'm currently finishing my PhD, where I focus on hemispheric specialisation. I am looking at key sites
            of the semantic cognition network and exploring whether their differences in functional connnectivity 
            as assessed by resting state fMRI can tell us why the left hemisphere is more involved in certain aspects of language.</p>
